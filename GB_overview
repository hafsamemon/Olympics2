<p>
Great Britain was one of the 14 countries to compete in the first modern Olympic Games in 1896 in Athens and they have sent sportsmen and women to every Olympic Games since. After a strong track record at previous Olympic Games including a ranking of 3rd overall at the last Olympic Games in London it seems likely that they&rsquo;ll provide stiff competition in this year&rsquo;s Olympics.
